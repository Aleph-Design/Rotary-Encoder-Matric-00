# Rotary-Encoder-Matric-00
An attempt to create a project file structure for FreeRTOS and Arduino applications.

When the project get's bigger usually the main.cpp in Arduino get's larger and larger; and in the end you may lose the overview of the project.
This is an attempt to conquer just that. 
Also dividing a FreeRTOS project into multiple tasks is an opportunity to clarify the complexity.
